Over five harrowing days, Paton Walsh hikes the full 66-mile roadless route, documenting the heroism of everyday people, milked for cash by drug cartels and unwanted by any country, as they battle the dense rainforest in search of a better life.

                    "description": "A global technology outage grounded flights, knocked banks and hospital systems offline and media outlets off air on Friday in a massive disruption that affected companies and services around the world and highlighted dependence on software from a handful of providers.\n\nCyber expert James Bore explained the situation and said real harm would be caused by the outage because systems we\u2019ve come to rely on at critical times are not going to be available.\n\n\"This is going to take some time to fix, and this is the type of thing that is absolutely inevitable with the way that technology now works,\" he told the AP.\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said that the issue believed to be behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack \u2014 and that a fix was on the way. The company said the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows.\n\nBut hours after the problem was first detected, the disarray continued \u2014 and escalated.\n\nLong lines formed at airports in the U.S., Europe and Asia as airlines lost access to check-in and booking services at a time when many travelers are heading away on summer vacations. News outlets in Australia \u2014 where telecommunications were severely affected \u2014 were pushed off air for hours.\n\nHospitals and doctor's offices had problems with their appointment systems, while banks in South Africa and New Zealand reported outages to their payment system or websites and apps.\n\n\n#microsoft #microsoftnews #microsoftoutage #flight #stcokexchange #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\n\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

                        "description": "A global technology outage grounded flights, knocked banks and hospital systems offline and media outlets off air on Friday in a massive disruption that affected companies and services around the world and highlighted dependence on software from a handful of providers.\n\nCyber expert James Bore explained the situation and said real harm would be caused by the outage because systems we\u2019ve come to rely on at critical times are not going to be available.\n\n\"This is going to take some time to fix, and this is the type of thing that is absolutely inevitable with the way that technology now works,\" he told the AP.\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said that the issue believed to be behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack \u2014 and that a fix was on the way. The company said the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows.\n\nBut hours after the problem was first detected, the disarray continued \u2014 and escalated.\n\nLong lines formed at airports in the U.S., Europe and Asia as airlines lost access to check-in and booking services at a time when many travelers are heading away on summer vacations. News outlets in Australia \u2014 where telecommunications were severely affected \u2014 were pushed off air for hours.\n\nHospitals and doctor's offices had problems with their appointment systems, while banks in South Africa and New Zealand reported outages to their payment system or websites and apps.\n\n\n#microsoft #microsoftnews #microsoftoutage #flight #stcokexchange #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\n\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

It was an epic India vs Pakistan duel at the Olympics and it promises to become bigger and bigger in the coming years.\n\nNeeraj Chopra was favourite to win gold medal in the men's javelin final in Paris. However, Arshad Nadeem stunned the field with an Olympic record throw of 92.97m. Neeraj came close to breaching the 90m-mark, but it was not enough.\n\nWhile India celebrated Neeraj Chopra's historic silver medal, there were bittersweet feelings too. Indian sports fans were not used to seeing Neeraj finish second-best often.\n\nNeeraj Chopra has promised to improve. He conceded that breaching 90m is a necessity.\n\nHowever, it was Arshad Nadeem's day as he stole the thunder at Stade de France in Paris. With limited support and facilities back home, Neeraj became Pakistan's first-ever track and field Olympic gold medalist.\n\nThe reactions in both countries was heartwarming.

After the heartbreak of the World Cup at home last year, the Indian men\u2019s hockey team won its successive Olympic bronze medal. It came after India beat Spain 3-2 in the final in Paris on August 8.\n\nIt was the 13th medal for Olympic hockey's most successful men\u2019s team. It was a validation for the core group of Indian players, including PR Sreejesh, Manpreet Singh and Amit Rohidas, who had a topsy-turvy ride after winning the Tokyo Olympics medal.\n\nIn Paris, India was not labelled as a favourite after being drawn into a tough group that also included Australia and Belgium. However, they laid down an early marker after hammering Australia.\n\nWith the victory, India\u2019s legendary PR Sreejesh bowed out. He was emotional after the win as he bowed down to his equipment and recreated the Tokyo 2020 pose.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a glimmer of hope for Vinesh Phogat, who was disqualified. The wrestler retired in a heartbreaking post on social media on Thursday. She appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, saying she should be given a joint silver medal for her actions on the opening day of the women\u2019s 50kg wrestling competition in Paris.\n\nAkshay Ramesh and Saurabh Kumar discuss the historic hockey victory and the details of Vinesh Phogat\u2019s appeal to the CAS.\n\n\nWatch!\n\nProduced by Anna Priyadarshini\n \n\nYou can also tune in here:\n \n \nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6cmziLOjlHLlur13YqmtEf\n \n \nApple Podcasts:  https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fashion-scoop/id1728808543\n \n \nClick here for the latest podcast: https://podcasts.indiatoday.in/\n \n \nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IndiaTodayPodcasts\n \n \nFollow us on Twitter: https://x.com/IndiaTodayPods\n                        Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/indiatodaypodcasts/\n \n\n\n#Olympics #Olympics2024 #ParisOlympics #ParisOlympics2024 #France #Podcasts #OlympicTales #IndiaAtOlympics #OlympicsPodcast #IndianAthletes #OlympicGames #Badminton #VineshPhogat  #OlympicSemiFinal #Wrestling #vineshphogatnews #vineshphogatmatch #vineshphogatdisqualified  #parisolympicslive #indiatoday #NeerajChopra #Javelin #JavelinThrow #Hockey #Silver #Bronze #PRSreejesh\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

This significant event marks a new chapter in the representation of the Indian community in British politics. Shivani Raja's victory in Leicester East is especially noteworthy as it ends the Labour Party's 37-year dominance in the constituency. Her triumph, defeating Rajesh Agrawal with 14,526 votes, is a testament to her strong campaign and the support she garnered from the community.

The former Karnataka Chief Minister also questioned why his and his father, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda's names, were brought up since the case was \"not a family issue\".\n\nExplicit videos purportedly showing Prajwal Revanna went viral on social media just two days before the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka on April 26. The JD(S) MP is seeking a second term from the Hassan Lok Sabha seat.\n\n#indiatoday #jds #prajvalrevanna #sexualabuse #domestichelpabuse #karnatakagovernment #nsitprobe #fir\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

                    "description": "Iran launched around 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month. The attack lasted for five hours and 99 per cent of drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel. The Israeli military said that it was on high alert and monitoring all targets. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened the Israeli war cabinet at military headquarters in Tel Aviv after Iran's attack. Meanwhile, the US said it stood by Israel and will \"support their defence\". In response, Iran's mission to the United Nations said the US must stay away from the conflict between Iran and Israel and warned that Tehran's response would be more severe if Israel retaliates.

On Twitter, he argued that the CAA is designed to reduce Muslims to second-class citizens. He questioned the government's delay in implementing the rules and suggested that the CAA, along with NPR-NRC, is meant to target Muslims. Owaisi urged Indians who opposed the CAA and NPR-NRC on the streets to continue their opposition.#caaimplementation #caa #asaduddinowaisi #aimim #caarollout #godsesthoughts #citizenshipamendmentact #muslimrights #secondclasscitizens #socialmedia #twitter #electionseason #asylum #persecuted #religion #nationality #government #rules #nprnrc #india #indians #streets #oppose\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.\n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button!\n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

On Twitter, he argued that the CAA is designed to reduce Muslims to second-class citizens. He questioned the government's delay in implementing the rules and suggested that the CAA, along with NPR-NRC, is meant to target Muslims. Owaisi urged Indians who opposed the CAA and NPR-NRC on the streets to continue their opposition.#caaimplementation #caa #asaduddinowaisi #aimim #caarollout #godsesthoughts #citizenshipamendmentact #muslimrights #secondclasscitizens #socialmedia #twitter #electionseason #asylum #persecuted #religion #nationality #government #rules #nprnrc #india #indians #streets #oppose\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.\n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button!\n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

In the days that followed, 50,000 people were killed. \n\nBut what's been barely reported is that Google was operating an earthquake early warning system in the country. The company claims it sent out millions of warnings before the quake hit. \n\nBut BBC teams in Turkey and Silicon Valley can't find evidence that this warning was widely received by people in the earthquake zone. \n\nIn this special report for BBC Newsnight, Anna Foster is in Turkey and James Clayton is in San Francisco.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE\u00a0bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n\u2014\n\nWebsite:\u00a0https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsnight\u00a0\nTwitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight\u00a0\nFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsnight\n\n#Newsnight #BBCNews",

In the days that followed, 50,000 people were killed. \n\nBut what's been barely reported is that Google was operating an earthquake early warning system in the country. The company claims it sent out millions of warnings before the quake hit. \n\nBut BBC teams in Turkey and Silicon Valley can't find evidence that this warning was widely received by people in the earthquake zone. \n\nIn this special report for BBC Newsnight, Anna Foster is in Turkey and James Clayton is in San Francisco.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE\u00a0bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n\u2014\n\nWebsite:\u00a0https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsnight\u00a0\nTwitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight\u00a0\nFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsnight\n\n#Newsnight #BBCNews"

                    "description": "When former FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced Qatar's victory in 2010, there was widespread scepticism about how exactly this tiny desert state, with no World Cup experience and scorching summer temperatures, had won.\n\nAllegations of corruption, vote-swapping, and links to trade deals at the highest levels of government have always been denied by organisers and remain unproven.\n\nBut there is no denying the build-up to this tournament has been especially troubled.\n\nThere have been persistent fears over the human toll of building the infrastructure required in such a short period of time and in such a climate, along with discriminatory laws that prohibit homosexuality and curtail women's freedoms through male guardianship rules.\n\nBBC Analysis editor Ros Atkins looks at how Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup, as well as the human rights and environmental issues surrounding the tournament.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#Qatar #WorldCup2022 #BBCNews",

                        "description": "When former FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced Qatar's victory in 2010, there was widespread scepticism about how exactly this tiny desert state, with no World Cup experience and scorching summer temperatures, had won.\n\nAllegations of corruption, vote-swapping, and links to trade deals at the highest levels of government have always been denied by organisers and remain unproven.\n\nBut there is no denying the build-up to this tournament has been especially troubled.\n\nThere have been persistent fears over the human toll of building the infrastructure required in such a short period of time and in such a climate, along with discriminatory laws that prohibit homosexuality and curtail women's freedoms through male guardianship rules.\n\nBBC Analysis editor Ros Atkins looks at how Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup, as well as the human rights and environmental issues surrounding the tournament.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#Qatar #WorldCup2022 #BBCNews"

He stared ahead with arms folded before turning around to hug some of the associates on his legal team.\n\nHe faced two charges related to lying about his drug use on a federal background check, and one for possessing a gun while addicted to or using drugs.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

                    "description": "Boris Johnson has apologised, at the UK\u2019s official inquiry into the Covid pandemic, for the way his government handled the crisis.   The former Prime Minister said it had \"vastly underestimated\" the threat posed by the virus.\n\nMr Johnson admitted that as Prime Minister he should have realised sooner how serious the crisis was. He said he was sorry for the pain, loss and suffering of victims and families. \n\nMr Johnson has been accused of lying about government decisions during the pandemic.   It's accused of failing to protect elderly people in care homes.  The UK suffered one of the highest death rates from Covid in western Europe.\n\nMr Johnson was forced to resign as Prime Minister after it emerged that parties had been held in Downing Street in breach of the government\u2019s Covid restrictions. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Vicki Young and Hugh Pym\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

                        "description": "Boris Johnson has apologised, at the UK\u2019s official inquiry into the Covid pandemic, for the way his government handled the crisis.   The former Prime Minister said it had \"vastly underestimated\" the threat posed by the virus.\n\nMr Johnson admitted that as Prime Minister he should have realised sooner how serious the crisis was. He said he was sorry for the pain, loss and suffering of victims and families. \n\nMr Johnson has been accused of lying about government decisions during the pandemic.   It's accused of failing to protect elderly people in care homes.  The UK suffered one of the highest death rates from Covid in western Europe.\n\nMr Johnson was forced to resign as Prime Minister after it emerged that parties had been held in Downing Street in breach of the government\u2019s Covid restrictions. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Vicki Young and Hugh Pym\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

                    "description": "GameStop Soars As \"Roaring Kitty\" Returns, Raising Speculations of Another Meme Stock Rally | Firstpost Tech & Trade\n\nShares of American video game retailer GameStop skyrocketed nearly 179% in just two days of trading this week, May 13 and 14. The catalyst for this rally was a social media post on an account named \"Roaring Kitty,\" handled by Keith Gill, a social media influencer who advises people on stock market investment. Gill has been credited with setting off the so-called \"Reddit rally\" in January 2021 with his bullish calls on GameStop. The frenzy led to massive losses for many hedge funds and even resulted in Melvin Capital shutting down. He has now resurfaced by sharing memes on his account on the X platform. So what happened in 2021? How did \"Roaring Kitty\" help push GameStop shares into a frenzy, and more importantly, will it happen again? Let's try to understand.\n\n---\n\nShares | Keith Gill | Investment | Stock Market | X | GameStop | Social Media | Reddit | Video Game | Retailer | Trading | Hedge Funds | Melvin Capital | Influencer | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#shares #keithgill #investment #stockmarket #twitter #gamestop #socialmedia #reddit #videogame #retailer #trading #hedgefunds #melvin #influencer #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

The catalyst for this rally was a social media post on an account named \"Roaring Kitty,\" handled by Keith Gill, a social media influencer who advises people on stock market investment. Gill has been credited with setting off the so-called \"Reddit rally\" in January 2021 with his bullish calls on GameStop. The frenzy led to massive losses for many hedge funds and even resulted in Melvin Capital shutting down. He has now resurfaced by sharing memes on his account on the X platform. So what happened in 2021? How did \"Roaring Kitty\" help push GameStop shares into a frenzy, and more importantly, will it happen again? Let's try to understand.\n\n---\n\nShares | Keith Gill | Investment | Stock Market | X | GameStop | Social Media | Reddit | Video Game | Retailer | Trading | Hedge Funds | Melvin Capital | Influencer | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#shares #keithgill #investment #stockmarket #twitter #gamestop #socialmedia #reddit #videogame #retailer #trading #hedgefunds #melvin #influencer #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

The protesters have been demanding that the government secure a Gaza ceasefire deal immediately to allow for the return of captives taken by Hamas from Israel, early elections and the resignation of Netanyahu. Hamas took more than 200 captives during its attack on army outposts and surrounding villages in southern Israel on October 7. Nearly half were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November in exchange for several Palestinians held prisoner by Israel.\n\n---\n\nIsrael Hamas War | Israel | Benjamin Netanyahu | Protests | Israeli Hostages | Hamas | Gaza | Palestine | War | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#israelhamaswar #israel #benjaminnetanyahu #protests #israelihostages #hamas #gaza #palestine #war #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

The protesters have been demanding that the government secure a Gaza ceasefire deal immediately to allow for the return of captives taken by Hamas from Israel, early elections and the resignation of Netanyahu. Hamas took more than 200 captives during its attack on army outposts and surrounding villages in southern Israel on October 7. Nearly half were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November in exchange for several Palestinians held prisoner by Israel.\n\n---\n\nIsrael Hamas War | Israel | Benjamin Netanyahu | Protests | Israeli Hostages | Hamas | Gaza | Palestine | War | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#israelhamaswar #israel #benjaminnetanyahu #protests #israelihostages #hamas #gaza #palestine #war #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

Sheikh Hasina's resignation comes in the aftermath of deadly protests across the country against the government and job quotas. Celebrations erupted in the capital Dhaka and protesters stormed the prime minister's residence as Sheikh Hasina fled. Where is Sheikh Hasina headed? Is the Bangladesh army taking over? Where is Bangladesh headed? To answer all these questions, Firstpost spoke to Ali Riaz, Distinguished Professor at Illinois State University.

Where is Bangladesh headed? To answer all these questions, Firstpost spoke to Ali Riaz, Distinguished Professor at Illinois State University.

Twelve children were killed after a rocket strike hit a football pitch in the Golan Heights, an Israel-annexed territory disputed with Syria. Israel says it is the deadliest attack on its people since October 7. Israel has vowed revenge and has said the enemy will pay a heavy price. The attack forced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to shorten his US trip and return home. For a war with already widening fronts, why is the focus now on Golan Heights?

The heavy rain inundated streets, disrupted traffic and impacted daily life. The downpour began before dawn and is anticipated to continue intermittently for a week, as per Pakistani authorities. They warned that the rains could trigger flash floods and landslides. The intensity of the rainfall led to widespread flooding, with rainwater seeping into wards of hospitals. Some areas recorded an unprecedented 353 millimetres of rain within three hours, surpassing the previous 44-year record set in July 1980, which was 332 millimetres over the same period.

The bombing comes after a surprise attack from the Ukrainian army earlier this week, which appeared to be the most significant assault on Russian soil since Moscow invaded Kyiv in February 2022. In their boldest operation yet, the Ukrainian forces entered Kursk region on Tuesday with reportedly 1,000 troops, armed with Western armoured vehicles, artillery, and drones. They also released footage claiming that Russian forces are surrendering to the Ukrainian troops. After this incursion, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a state of emergency in Kursk and announced the deployment of additional troops and munitions to the region. On Vantage tonight, Palki Sharma brings you the full story.\n\n---\n\nRussia | Ukraine | Attack | Supermarket | Kursk Region | Vladimir Putin | Volodymyr Zelensky | Russia Ukraine War | Firstpost | World News | News Live | Vantage | Palki Sharma | News\n\n#russia #ukraine #vladimirputin #volodymyrzelensky #russiaukrainewar #firstpost #vantageonfirstpost #palkisharma #worldnews\n\nVantage is a ground-breaking news, opinions, and current affairs show from Firstpost.

                        "description": "LIVE: Russia Bombs Ukraine, As Ukrainian Troops Fight in Russia's Kursk | Vantage with Palki Sharma\n\nRussia bombed a supermarket in eastern Ukraine today (August 9), killing at least 10 people and injuring 35 others. The bombing comes after a surprise attack from the Ukrainian army earlier this week, which appeared to be the most significant assault on Russian soil since Moscow invaded Kyiv in February 2022. In their boldest operation yet, the Ukrainian forces entered Kursk region on Tuesday with reportedly 1,000 troops, armed with Western armoured vehicles, artillery, and drones. They also released footage claiming that Russian forces are surrendering to the Ukrainian troops. After this incursion, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a state of emergency in Kursk and announced the deployment of additional troops and munitions to the region.

Iran has blamed Israel for the attack; however, Israel has not claimed responsibility for the strike. Iran has vowed to retaliate against Israel. The global community has different reactions to Iran's imminent retaliatory attack on Israel.

Britain has been hit by a series of riots that erupted early last week after three young girls were killed in a knife attack in Southport, northwest England, triggering a wave of false messaging online that wrongly identified the suspected killer as an Islamist migrant. Rioters descended on towns and cities, including Liverpool, where they were seen storming a shop and burning down a library.\n\nAlso on Vantage Shots:\n- A cargo ship exploded into flames in China.\n- Giant pandas make public debut at San Diego Zoo\n- August 9, 1173: Italy began constructing the Leaning Tower Of Pisa\n\n---\n\nUK Riots | Bodycam Footage | Police | Attack | Fireworks | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#ukriots #police #attack #fireworks #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

When he emerged, his age had reversed by 10 years. Before the mission, 55-year-old Dituri\u2019s biological age was 44. But his biological age reduced to 34 after he emerged out of the water. The diver lived in a bunker under the Atlantic Ocean as part of NASA study. He was living in a highly pressurised environment. High pressure can reverse the body's age down to the cellular level. So Dituri's health underwent remarkable transformation during the underwater mission. How did it happen? Is it possible to reverse age without living in an underwater bunker?

                        "description": "Scientist Lives in Underwater Bunker, De-ages by 10 Years | Vantage with Palki Sharma\n\nScientist Joseph Dituri spent a record-breaking 100 days underwater. When he emerged, his age had reversed by 10 years. Before the mission, 55-year-old Dituri\u2019s biological age was 44. But his biological age reduced to 34 after he emerged out of the water. The diver lived in a bunker under the Atlantic Ocean as part of NASA study. He was living in a highly pressurised environment. High pressure can reverse the body's age down to the cellular level. So Dituri's health underwent remarkable transformation during the underwater mission. How did it happen? Is it possible to reverse age without living in an underwater bunker? Palki Sharma brings you the report.\n\n---\n\nUnderwater | Ocean Floor | Scientist | Joseph Dituri | NASA | Firstpost | World News | Vantage | Palki Sharma\n\n#nasa #aging #underwater #ocean #josephdituri #firstpost #vantageonfirstpost #palkisharma #worldnews\n\nVantage is a ground-breaking news, opinions, and current affairs show from Firstpost.

The scene at the rally was charged with energy, as thousands of Trump supporters waved flags, wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats, and shouting slogans in unison. The former president's remarks were interspersed with applause and standing ovations as he reiterated his commitment to \"protecting American values\" and reversing the policies of the current administration. Trump again attacked Harris in personal terms and criticised her for not doing interviews or major press conferences since she became the Democratic candidate.\n\n---\n\nUS | US Elections 2024 | Donald Trump | JD Vance | Trump Rally | Kamala Harris | Tim Walz | #Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#usa #uselections2024 #donaldtrump #jdvance #trumprally #kamalaharris #timwalz #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

The scene at the rally was charged with energy, as thousands of Trump supporters waved flags, wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats, and shouting slogans in unison. The former president's remarks were interspersed with applause and standing ovations as he reiterated his commitment to \"protecting American values\" and reversing the policies of the current administration. Trump again attacked Harris in personal terms and criticised her for not doing interviews or major press conferences since she became the Democratic candidate.\n\n---\n\nUS | US Elections 2024 | Donald Trump | JD Vance | Trump Rally | Kamala Harris | Tim Walz | #Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#usa #uselections2024 #donaldtrump #jdvance #trumprally #kamalaharris #timwalz #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

                        "description": "India's Paris Olympics campaign concluded as Reetika Hooda fell short in the wrestling quarterfinals, and golfers Aditi Ashok and Diksha Dagar finished out of medal contention. A total of 117 Indian athletes participated across 16 sports at the Paris Games: archery, athletics, badminton, boxing, equestrian, golf, hockey, judo, rowing, sailing, shooting, swimming, wrestling, table tennis, and tennis. India clinched six medals at the Paris Olympics, one silver and five bronze. Although hopes were high for a historic performance, the country fell just short of surpassing its previous best at the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics in 2021, when they secured seven medals (1 gold, 2 silver, and 4 bronze.) and ranked 48th.\n\n#Olympics2024 #Wrestling #VineshPhogat #VineshPhogatAnnouncesRetirement #ParisOlympics2024 \n\nAbout NDTV (English news channel):\r\n\r\nNDTV is India's Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.

Although the situation has improved significantly since Friday's chaotic scenes, passengers continue to face challenges, particularly at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI).\n\nAt Delhi's IGI Airport's Terminal 3, passengers experienced some improvement today, but a few problems persist.

These first Winter YOG to be held in Asia will build on the Olympic Games legacy and engage even more young people through various activities before, throughout and after the Games.\n\nThe vision of Gangwon 2024 is to let the youth celebrate peaceful coexistence and unity through sport to create a better future together. The aim is to drive positive change and social unity in the region, impacting society in the areas of sport, culture and education. Gangwon 2024 will benefit from many of the facilities used for PyeongChang 2018. This will ensure a cost-efficient and sustainable YOG, and, at the same time, provide the participating athletes with the opportunity to compete in some of the same sites as Olympians did a few years before.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 #Beijing2022 replays: https://oly.ch/B22Replays\n\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 #Tokyo2020 replays: https://oly.ch/T20Replays\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f News from the Olympic world: https://oly.ch/News",

These first Winter YOG to be held in Asia will build on the Olympic Games legacy and engage even more young people through various activities before, throughout and after the Games.\n\nThe vision of Gangwon 2024 is to let the youth celebrate peaceful coexistence and unity through sport to create a better future together. The aim is to drive positive change and social unity in the region, impacting society in the areas of sport, culture and education. Gangwon 2024 will benefit from many of the facilities used for PyeongChang 2018. This will ensure a cost-efficient and sustainable YOG, and, at the same time, provide the participating athletes with the opportunity to compete in some of the same sites as Olympians did a few years before.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 #Beijing2022 replays: https://oly.ch/B22Replays\n\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 #Tokyo2020 replays: https://oly.ch/T20Replays\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f News from the Olympic world: https://oly.ch/News"

In her first outdoor meet, she set a world record for 100m. The 1928 100m was the first women's track event to be contested in Olympic history. Robinson won the final by half a metre in what was only her fourth track meet ever. She also earned a silver medal in the 4x100m relay.\nThree years after her Olympic triumph, Robinson was badly injured in an airplane crash. The man who found her thought she was dead, so he put her in his car trunk and drove her to a mortician. She was unconscious for seven weeks and she could not walk normally for two years\u2026but she did survive. Robinson wanted to return to competitive sprinting, but she was no longer able to bend her leg fully at the knee, so she could not assume the crouched starting position. She could, however, run in relays. In 1936, Betty Robinson won a second gold medal as a member of the U.S. 4x100m relay team.\n_____________________________________________________\n\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 #Beijing2022 replays: https://oly.ch/B22Replays\n\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 #Tokyo2020 replays: https://oly.ch/T20Replays\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f News from the Olympic world: https://oly.ch/News",

The result was not the one expected but the fans stayed behind to applaud the team, support them and thank them for their efforts. The players, downcast after elimination, responded to the gesture for the fans with a message that they would be back sooner rather than later. \n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW:\n\u25b6 www.youtube.com/user/fcbarcelona \n\n\ud83d\udcf1 App: http://barca.link/kXum50R6rNO\n\u26bd Bar\u00e7a One: http://barca.link/I32O50QVbj2\n\ud83c\udf10 Site: www.fcbarcelona.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fcbarcelona\n\ud835\udd4f Twitter: http://twitter.com/FCBarcelona\n\ud83c\udfb6 Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fcbarcelona \n\ud83d\udd35 Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/fcbarcelona\n\ud83d\udc7e Discord: https://discord.gg/fcbarcelonaofficial\n\n\ud83d\udecd Get all official Bar\u00e7a apparel from FC Barcelona's online store: http://barca.link/j8QH30qQh4Y \n\ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd34 #FCBarcelona"

Ancelotti's team got off on the right foot in the league and in the match in Bilbao as well, with Rodrygo opening the scoring in the 28th minute and becoming Real Madrid's first goalscorer of the season. The win at San Mam\u00e9s was secured with a debut golazo from Jude Bellingham just eight minutes later. Join us for an exclusive peek into the Real Madrid dressing room as well, with the team going out on to the pitch with a special t-shirt sending encouragement to Thibaut Courtois.

It was Almer\u00eda that opened the scoring with an early goal by former Real Madrid youth team player Sergio Arribas, but new LaLiga darling Jude Bellingham equalled the score with a stunning goal in the 19th minute. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team looked for the full comeback and it was Bellingham again who got on the scoresheet in the 60th minute with a header. Vini Jr. sent a rocket in the back of the net in the 73rd minute to complete the scoreline.\n#Almer\u00edaRealMadrid | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n\ud83c\udd95\ud83d\udcfa RM PLAY: play.realmadrid.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa5  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCR\u00cdBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 FOLLOW US | S\u00cdGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n\ud83d\udcb3 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT"

It was Almer\u00eda that opened the scoring with an early goal by former Real Madrid youth team player Sergio Arribas, but new LaLiga darling Jude Bellingham equalled the score with a stunning goal in the 19th minute. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team looked for the full comeback and it was Bellingham again who got on the scoresheet in the 60th minute with a header. Vini Jr. sent a rocket in the back of the net in the 73rd minute to complete the scoreline.\n#Almer\u00edaRealMadrid | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n\ud83c\udd95\ud83d\udcfa RM PLAY: play.realmadrid.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa5  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCR\u00cdBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 FOLLOW US | S\u00cdGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n\ud83d\udcb3 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT",

It was Almer\u00eda that opened the scoring with an early goal by former Real Madrid youth team player Sergio Arribas, but new LaLiga darling Jude Bellingham equalled the score with a stunning goal in the 19th minute. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team looked for the full comeback and it was Bellingham again who got on the scoresheet in the 60th minute with a header. Vini Jr. sent a rocket in the back of the net in the 73rd minute to complete the scoreline.\n#Almer\u00edaRealMadrid | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n\ud83c\udd95\ud83d\udcfa RM PLAY: play.realmadrid.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa5  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCR\u00cdBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 FOLLOW US | S\u00cdGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n\ud83d\udcb3 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT"

Join the team, including coach Zinedine Zidane, top scorer Karim Benzema and Casemiro, as they travelled from Madrid to the Andalusian city and follow their pre-match preparations and post-match declarations. Luka Modri\u0107 opened the scoring, which was doubled when Rodrygo netted just before the break. Jorge Molina reduced the deficit for the hosts but strikes in quick succession from \u00c1lvaro Odriozola and Karim Benzema sealed an impressive win for Zidane's men, who will continue their LaLiga title fight at Athletic Club on Sunday.\n\n0:20 Trip to Granada\n0:40 Arrival at hotel\n0:59 Arrival at Stadium\n1:14 Warm up\n2:34 Start of match\n2:49 Modric 1st goal\n2:55 Second goal\n3:04 3rd goal \n3:11 Rodrygo post-match\n3:33 Courtois post match\n3:52 Zidane post-match\n\n\ud83c\udfa5  SUBSCRIBE \nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 FOLLOW US \nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\n\n\ud83d\udcb3 BECOME A MADRIDISTA: https://www.realmadrid.com/en/fans/madridistas/international\n\n\ud83d\ude4c JOIN THE MADRIDISTA NATION: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/becomesupporter/RealMadrid/?entrypoint_surface=youtube"
